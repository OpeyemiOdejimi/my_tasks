# Basic usage of print()
print("Hello!")
print("Welcome to Python programming.")

# Using peint( with variables
name = "Aisha"
age = 25
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)

# Using f-strings with print()
name = "Bola"
score = 92
print(f"{name} scored {score} in the exam.")

# Using  string concatination
first_name = "Ada"
last_name = "Lovelace"
print("Full name: " + first_name + " " + last_name)

# Comma vs concatenation
print("Hello", "world!")      # With comma
print("Hello" + " " + "world")     # With concatenation
